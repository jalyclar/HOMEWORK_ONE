trigonometry.py ----------------

Python file does following tasks:

1. Takes the argument --function=cos,sin,sinc and plots the inputs from -10 to 10 in steps of 0.05. It should be able to plot any combination of inputs: --function=cos, --function=cos,sin, etc. on the same plot. Be sure to include a title, axis annotations, and a legend

2. Takes an optional argument --write=filename.txt and writes an ASCII file with a table. The first column should contain floating point numbers from -10 to 10 in steps of 0.05. The following columns should provide the corresponding values of the trigonometric function input(s).

3. Takes an optional argument --read from file=filename.txt that reads in the ASCII file and produces the corresponding plot. Note that this program  should rely on the table from the file and not attempt to reproduce the data on-the-fly.

4. Takes an optional input --print=jpeg,eps,pdf that produces the plot in the corresponding format(s).
